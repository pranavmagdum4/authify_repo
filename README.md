# Description
This project implements user authentication and registration
features using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in a full-stack application 
built with Node.js, Express.js, React.js, and MySQL. 
The primary focus is on enhancing security by 
mitigating common web vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
